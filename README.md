# Investigative-Study-on-Generative-Models-for-Face2Sketch-and-Sketch2Face
we demonstrate the implication of different variations of autoencoders and Generative adversarial network
(or GANs) on CUHK and Feret dataset to perform photo2sketch and sketch2photo usecase.

It contains all the codes related to the computer vision course work of Photos2Sketch and Sketch2Photos

Following models were carried out to implement the mentioned:
1. Dense Autoencoder
2. Convolutional Autoencoder(CAE)
3. Convolutional Variational Autoencoder(CVAE)
4. Pix2Pix Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN Network)
5. Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks
